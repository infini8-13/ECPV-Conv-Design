### Abstract
An intermediate dc-link electrolytic capacitor, which is used in three-phase inverters
in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and uninterrupted power supplies, has
reliability concerns and is a common reason for inverter failure and short lifespan. The
size and price of the system are increased by the electrolytic capacitor’s high capacity.

This problem has recently been addressed in research on electrolytic capacitor-less
inverters employing the six-pulse modulation approach and high-frequency power
conversion. Due to the lack of a capacitor in the dc-link, closed-loop operation and
control have some limitations.

The electrolytic capacitor-less six-pulse DC Link threephase inverter’s closed-loop functioning, design, and implementation are discussed in this work involving dual-bridge converter and film capacitor.
